# small module implementing the Hilbert-Huang EMD process and the Hilbert Transform 
#

development project to explore the capabilities of the EMD coupled to the application of the Hilbert Transform on filtered signals. 

naive implementation of Hilbert-Huang, but it seems to work.

should become the set of methods for an EMD and a HilbertTransf class.
